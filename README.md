<br>Custom launcher/game updater for Albion Online.
<br>**It doesn't offers cheat or injection or anything, it isn't mean to be better than the official launcher, it's just a training in Python.**
<br>I managed to understand how the launcher updates itself and the game and how it downloads/checks files so I had the idea to make my own version in Tkinter/Python3... Tkinter isn't the best GUI builder but at least it works :D.

Reading the source code can lead to several headaches and mental health problems.

**Online player number is scraped from Steam not from Albion it's is not really representative**
